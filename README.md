# Turn-Based-Game
A program that runs on the console terminal where the player is given random health and attack damage and has to clear a queue of monsters. There are spells that the creature and players have. This is one of my CIS 163 project. We had to create our own linked list queue.

# What I learned:
- How a linked list works.
- How to create a queue and its functions
- How to create a linked list and its functions
